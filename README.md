Philip Wingemo - Some design choices
> "Why Jquery over React? You would not want to use jQuery to build a complex web application with multiple views and complex functionality but jQuery is a fine choice for simple fast web building. We have also used an adapter built in PHP to simulate the call from front-end to back-end"

## Software design pattern. 

Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC)

Model
The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.[5] It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

View
Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

Controller
Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
